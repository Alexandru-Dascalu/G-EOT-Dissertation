		Ever since the publication of the AlexNet architecture \cite{alexnet} in 2012, deep neural networks have seen an explosion in popularity, and are used in a wide variety of applications, like malware detection, biometric security, self-driving cars, etc. However, it has been proven that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations are added to the normal input to fool the victim model into giving a specific wrong output. Neural networks used in safety-critical applications can therefore be a cybersecurity risk.
		
		Existing attack methods that work in physical settings, not just on 2D images, are white-box, they require full access to the victim model. Another line of research created attack methods against black-box victim models. In this project, I present G-EOT, the first generative model that attempts to create physical 3D adversarial objects that fool a black-box victim. It is a combination of the EOT framework \cite{athalye} for creating 3D adversarial objects and a generator-simulator model \cite{zheng_black_box_GAN} for black-box attacks. 
		
		The experiments show that the model is unable to learn much throughout its training history. They suggest that the main issue is the large variation of the gradient between optimisation steps, due to the rendering of the object in random poses, which is necessary for creating robust adversarial noise for 3D objects. Further work is needed to see if the issue can be overcome.
		
		Finally, the experiments suggest show that a black-box version of EOT would be far more convenient for an attacker, and the thesis discusses how that could be achieved. On the other hand, a successful version of G-EOT would be very useful for augmenting datasets to make neural networks impervious to adversarial attacks.

	\begin{Acknowledgements}
		First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my mother for all the emotional support and encouragement that she has given me over the past academic year and for being there when I needed her.
		
		Furthermore, I would like to thank Dr Jingjing Deng for being a great supervisor and for guiding me towards realistic project goals. In addition, Mr Hanchi Ren and Dr Mike Edwards greatly helped me with technical questions related to Tensorflow.
		
		Moreover, I want to thank Mr Szabolcs Dombi, the developer of ModernGL, for his quick replies to my emails in regards to technical issues related to ModernGL. I am also grateful to user "einarf" from the ModernGL Discord for his help.
		
		Finally, I am thankful to my former coursemates Avi Varma and Radu Bucurescu. Avi gave me support and suggestions and shared with me things he learnt when doing his project a year ago, while Radu taught me the basics of OpenGL rendering.
